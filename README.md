# Personal Projects
This repo is to showcase the side projects that I worked on during my time in General Assembly.

## Welcome
### Whose GitHub did you come to?
My name is Marty. My current username on all mainstream internet content is MartyEternal, and I founded MTE: Monstrous Talented and Exceptional.

I'm a father of two, and I was just laid off due to financial reasons at the EFTPOS company I was working for for the last year and a half. I suppose that means that I have a lot of time, until I land another job, to work on my side projects. My typing speed, at the time of writing this, averages out at 90WPM - if I have something to type or know what I'm going to type. My creativity stat is, unfortunately, quite shabby. I've thought about my personal stats, as if I were a game character haha
